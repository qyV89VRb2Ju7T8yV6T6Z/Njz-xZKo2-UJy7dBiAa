                various artforms from abled artists. The success of this Exhibition led to the idea that advantage
                should be taken of this magnificent collection to build up the nucleus collection of the National
                Museum. State Governments, Museum authorities and private donors, who had participated in the
                exhibition, were approached for the gift or loan of artefacts, and most of them responded generously.
