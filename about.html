                collectors and has enabled them to view, appreciate and acquire art from our handpicked selection of
                various artforms from abled artists. The success of this Exhibition led to the idea that advantage
                should be taken of this magnificent collection to build up the nucleus collection of the National
                Museum. State Governments, Museum authorities and private donors, who had participated in the
                exhibition, were approached for the gift or loan of artefacts, and most of them responded generously.

                Kejriwal Young Artist Awards to empower and nurture young talent.
